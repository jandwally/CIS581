  File clarification:
    Implement Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression. The goal is to create an uniformly distributed 
    points given the number of feature desired:
    - Input corner_matrix: H × W matrix representing the corner metric matrix.
    - Input max_pts: the number of corners desired.
    - Outpuy x: N × 1 vector representing the column coordinates of corners.
    - Output y: N × 1 vector representing the row coordinates of corners.
    - Output rmax: suppression radius used to get max pts corners.
